## Development

This package uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for managing git hooks and assumes you installed Flutter through [puro](http://puro.dev).

Not being able to run the hooks isn't dramatic, but the CI will reject unformatted code, so you should run `dart format .` in some way locally before committing.
